### Prediction of Coronary heart disease (CHD) risks
The 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) refers to the probability that a person will develop coronary heart disease within the next ten years. Accurate identification of the 10-year risk of future CHD enables healthcare providers to implement preventive strategies, including lifestyle changes, medications, and regular monitoring, thus greatly reducing the risk of CHD. In this study, we first examine 5 machine learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and 4 deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network, Residual Neural Network (ResNet), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and 1-dimensional Transformer Encoder (Trans-Encoder). Trained with 6 nominal variables (e.g. male, education, and so on) one- hot encoded and 8 continuous variables (e.g. age, BMI, and so on) with column-based standardization, the performance of these individual models achieved an AUROC between 0.498 and 0.717. Since ensemble models usually possess multiple advantages, such as improved accuracy, reduced overfitting, and higher robustness, we conducted a comprehensive model selection process and constructed the ensembles of these individual models with different combinations. However, most ensemble models didn’t reach the best performance achieved by individual models and even the best one reached an AUROC of 0.718. Finally, to seek explanations of this ordinary performance, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are applied to those models used for ensemble model construction, providing insight into the most important variables for CHD risk prediction.
